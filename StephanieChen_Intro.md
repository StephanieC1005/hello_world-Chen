Hi I'm Stephanie. I'm a junior majoring applied psychology at NYU. 
I haven’t learned SQL before, but I do have experience working with pandas from my data science classes.
I’m currently working with Professor Catalina to clean and integrate multiple datasets related to suicide and mental health among children in California.
